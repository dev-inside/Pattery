Title: HTML and Markdown-Formatted-Preview

====

Content: If you add a html, htm or a markdown-file to the content-directory, Pattery will render your code as preview. This is pretty cool to present your web-styleguide. You can edit the style in *system/assets/style.less*. You don't need to compile the less-file by yourself, because *Less.js* is already embed.

====

Pattern:

<section id="content">
    <article>
        <h2>Post-Title</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Facilis reiciendis iusto doloremque? Beatae, sapiente nam.
    </article>
</section>
